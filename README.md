## New Way to Learn Auscultation?

Mastering Cardiac Murmurs : the power of repetition (article in the folder)


## THE GAME DESIGN

* Find simplest, easiest, cheapest and fastest way to produce the project is to design the first level of the Acoustic Labyrinth Game
* The environment of the game will be the same as ‘’a blind person’s perspective’’, where you loose the sight you focus totally to sound.
* The feel of the game may be as ‘’The Blind Legend’’.
* There will be one or two sounds to study for the prototype. When the player takes the wrong route he will either hears normal beat of the heart. The goal is to find the exit through tracing the sound that is chosen.
* The game will start with a textual reinforcement: Lesson Text will be provided after choosing the sound to be mastered.
* In the second level a brief patient history (clinical story) may be given and asked the player to find which abnormality is it.
* Reduced & Increased Intensity according to coming close to exit or not.
* Graphics: A waveform of the sounds will be displayed for visual reinforcement.
* ‘’Progress Tracker Bar’’ can be included (Blue) limiting time.
* Badgets of medical studies levels will be assigned to success to ensure the repition. The goal is to lead the player study one sound 500 times (Scientific fact: %80 will be remembered)
* The prototype will be developed as soon as possible to make a test play with the medical students.


## BUILDING THE TEAM

A developer is needed as the core member for the team!


## FIRST PROTOTYPE

* The game has a black plain where the player is in the middle of a labyrinth where he hears the voice he wants to study. He has to trace the sound to find the exit in 120 seconds.
* There is a partial small map at the corner of the screen. It is showing where the player is situated on the labyrinth.
* There is a progress bar, time counting backwards (120seconds).
* When taking the wrong direction, like in moving opposite the direction of the exit you hear the normal beat of the heart.


## TEST PLAY

The first prototype is presented for the test play to:

1. Medical Students
2. Game Design Master Students


## REVIEWS

1. When you play, you memorise the route you are following you are not really listening.
2. The gameplay is supposed to make the player try again, but after 3 tries the player don't feel like trying.
3. Even if you know the route to the exit, it is still not easy to find the exit.
4. You actually play the game on the mini map, which makes the game a third person game.


## SECOND GAME DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE

The critics were right.


## Designed Second Prototype

When player comes to an entrance where he has to make a right or left turn; he taps at the corners of his smart phone and listens to the abnormal and normal sounds of the heart.
Chooses the abnormal sound by again tapping the corners of the phone to find the exit.
Play tested with a medical student and mentor.

## Result
Approved for teaching the sound.
