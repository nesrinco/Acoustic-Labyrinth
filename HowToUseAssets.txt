For using the paid Assets, mail me at nesrinco@gmail.com

I will mail you a copy of the Assets folder, 
containing all the assets (of course!).

You have to place the Assets folder in the main folder 
directory.

Then move the Scripts folder from the main directory to 
the Assets folder.

Now (and only now) you can open the project in Unity and 
continue development!
